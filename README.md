Final Project: Create a Card Deck
For our project we would like to create a deck of cards that could be shuffled, 
drawn and used for a card game. The MVP will create the deck of cards that can 
shuffle the cards and draw a card. For our first additional feature, we want the 
program to deal the cards out to at least 1-2 players. For our second additional feature,
we want the user to be able to view their hand. For our third additional feature, we want 
the user to be able to access their hand to add or subtract cards.
For our two additional features of this project would like to create a sort of card game. 
First, we will create a matching class that the player must match the color or number to 
the top of the deck. For the second additional feature, we want the user to have to say 
UNO- and if they forget, they get two additional cards.



Currently, to run UNO, run the Uno.JAVA to play in terminal. Enter the number for the card in the deck and then enter to place card. 
If a card is needed to be drawn or quit game select that number. 

To run the game in the GUI Run Uno.jar file, very similar to the terminal game enter the number
of the card you'd like to play and hit enter. Enter the number to draw a card if none can be played in the deck. Once the game is over
you can choose to restart with the restart button or exit the game chose the quit option or close the window. 

HAVE FUN!!
